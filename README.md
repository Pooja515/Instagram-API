InstagramClone: Full-Stack Java Application
Welcome to the InstagramClone project! This repository serveson building a full-stack Java application using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL. you'll gain the skills needed to create a fully functional web application that allows you to manage data using a user-friendly interface.

Project Overview
This Project covers the entire process of creating a web application, starting with the backend development using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA to interact with a MySQL database. We'll then move on to building the frontend using React, where we'll design and implement UI components that communicate with the backend API.

Key Concepts Covered: 

Setting up a new Spring Boot project
Creating and configuring a MySQL database with Spring Data JPA
Building RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations
Developing React components and managing component state
Integrating the frontend and backend using Fetch API
Optional: Deploying the application to a cloud hosting platform
Technologies Used


The project utilizes the following technologies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Chakra UI: A modular and accessible component library for React applications.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid custom design.
Redux: A state container for predictable state management in JavaScript apps.
Thunk: A middleware for Redux to handle asynchronous logic and interactions.
Spring Boot: An open-source framework for building microservices and applications.
MySQL: A free, open-source relational database management system.

Getting Started
To begin, follow the steps outlined in this repository to understand and implement the process of creating a full-stack Java application using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL. Whether you're new to development or experienced in the field, this  equips you with the knowledge to build feature-rich applications.
